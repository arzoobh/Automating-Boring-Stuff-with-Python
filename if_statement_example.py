###IF STATEMENT
##The expression in the if statement is called a condition but condition is
#just a name for an expressionin a flow control statement but technically
#a condition and expression are the same thing.

##If the condition in an IF statement evaluates to true the execution enters
#the indented code that follows.
#If the condition is false, the execution skips the indented code.
